    <h1>The Tempest</h1>
    <h2>Shakespeare homepage | The Tempest | Act 1, Scene 1</h2>
    <p><strong>SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Enter a Master and a Boatswain</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Master</strong><br>
    Boatswain!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Here, master: what cheer?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Master</strong><br>
    Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,<br> or we run ourselves aground: bestir,<br> bestir.</p>
    
    <p><em>Exit</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Enter Mariners</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!<br> yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the <br>master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,<br> if room enough!</p>
    
    <p><em>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>ALONSO</strong><br>
    Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? <br>Play the men.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    I pray now, keep below.</p>
    
    <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
    Where is the master, boatswain?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your <br>cabins: you do assist the storm.</p>
    
    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    Nay, good, be patient.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers <br>for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.</p>
    
    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    None that I more love than myself. You are a <br>counsellor; if you can command these elements to<br> silence, and work the peace of the present, we will<br> not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you <br>cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make<br> yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of <br>the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out <br>of our way, I say.</p>
    
    <p><em>Exit</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he<br> hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is <br>perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his <br>hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,<br> for our own doth little advantage. If he be not<br> born to be hanged, our case is miserable.</p>
    
    <p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring <br>her to try with main-course.</p>
    
    <p><em>A cry within</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    A plague upon this howling! they are louder than <br>the weather or our office.</p>
    
    <p><em>Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er <br>and drown? Have you a mind to sink?</p>
    
    <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
    A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, <br>incharitable dog!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Work you then.</p>
    
    <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
    Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! <br>We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.</p>
    
    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were<br> no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an <br>unstanched wench.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to <br>sea again; lay her off.</p>
    
    <p><em>Enter Mariners wet</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Mariners</strong><br>
    All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    What, must our mouths be cold?</p>
    
    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,<br> For our case is as theirs.</p>
    
    <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
    I'm out of patience.</p>
    
    <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
    We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards: <br>This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning<br> The washing of ten tides!</p>
    
    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    He'll be hang'd yet, <br>Though every drop of water swear against it <br>And gape at widest to glut him.</p>
    
    <p><em>A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
    Let's all sink with the king.</p>
    
    <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
    Let's take leave of him.</p>
    
    <p><em>Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an <br>acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any <br>thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain <br>die a dry death.</p>

    <p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
